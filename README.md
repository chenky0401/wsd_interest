# Word Sense Disambiguation


Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the problem of identifying what sense of a word is used in a sentence, that is, what is the meaning of the word as used in a particular context. Using the SenseEval 2 Corpus in NLTK, I've built a small classifier that can determine what sense of the noun `interest` is expressed in a sentence. The program could be easily extended and applied to the diambiguation of other nouns.
Sipmly run `python interest.py` to see the interactive program.
